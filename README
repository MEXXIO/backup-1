BackMeUp is a small script to help me create quick and dirty tar file containing backups of my file system.

Suppose you have a few directories and files which you want to store in a tar file. Like the following:

~/some/documents/
~/some/images/
/var/www/web_things/
some_file

You would have to create a file called bmu_files containing the information above. BackMeUp will create a tar file named backmeup_yyyy_mm_dd.tar, where yyyy, mm and dd is the date. The contents of the file will be:

backmeup_2013_06_23.tar
|--documents/
|--images/
|--web_things/
|--some_file

Noticed how the location of the directories and files is not preserved in the tar file.
